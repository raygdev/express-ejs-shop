    <h2>Different Facets of Development</h2>
    <p>The goal is to create separate branches for each facet of the development process. First by working with the fs module in node to create products that are stored in files.</p>
    <p> Eventually moving to MySQL and NoSQL Databases, I will implement separate branches for each database. None will be merged with main.</p>
